The code has been tested on Windows system, using Matlab 2012 and OpenCV 2.40+.

To compile the code:

1. Put the extracted files in a **<root_dir>**.
2. Install OpenCV 2.40+.
3. Go to **<root_dir>/BMS_CODE/** and use cmake to generate a sln file or a 
   make file. You may need to specify the relevant OpenCV paths.
4. Compile the code, and copy the executable to **<root_dir>**.
5. Launch Matlab and run **demo.m** in **<root_dir>**.
